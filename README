This is LIGGGHTS v3.8.0 with added contact models for accounting for adhesion using the JKR model.
Compared to the official release this repository also includes the following files in the src folder:

normal_model_jkr.h
tangential_model_jkr_tan.h
rolling_model_cdt_jkr.h

jkr_lookup_table.cpp
jkr_lookup_table.h

PolynomialRootFinder.h
PolynomialRootFinder.cpp

The model implementation is presented in:
Eidevåg, T., Abrahamsson, P., Eng, M., & Rasmuson, A. (2019). 
Modeling of dry snow adhesion during normal impact with surfaces. 
Powder Technology, 361, 1081–1092. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.10.085

Please be so kind to cite our work if you successfully use the contact models in your research.
